`Cost Pricing = Cost of Filament Used + (Print Time * (Average Hourly Power Consumption + Printer Hourly Value)) + Shipping Cost`

`Printer Hourly Value = Printer Cost / 2 Years of Hours Printed`

`2 Years of Hours Printed = 80 Hours * 104 Weeks`
- Printers take wear & tear over time, this cost is to recapture the capital expenditures of the printer
- I assume that each of my printers will run 80 hours a week for 2 years without significant rework
- The cost is my printer cost divided by the number of hours I expect the printer to run

`Shipping Cost = Shipping Rate From Pirate Ship + $1.00 + Box Cost`
- The $1.00 is to cover costs of packaging material.
- When shipping for cost, I will reuse packaging when possible to save cost.
- If I cannot reuse packaging I will add the cost of the box into the shipping cost

### V2.1609
`Printer Hourly Value = $0.18 = $1500 / 8,320`

`Average Hourly Power Consumption = $0.024 = 0.200kw * $0.12`

`Cost Pricing = Cost of Filament Used + (Print Time * $0.224)`
