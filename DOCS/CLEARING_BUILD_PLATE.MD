# CLEARING PEI BUILD PLATES

[MAIN MENU](/README.md)

 - Remove from printer by peeling upwards
 - Place parts-side-down over a Print Bin
 - Wipe magnetic layer of heated bed off, to remove any debris from becoming embedded into it
 - Replace with a prepared build plate
 - Start next print
 - Allow prievous build plate to fully cool to room temperature
 - Put on nitrate gloves
 - Most parts will fall away from the print bed from the cooling process, for those that do not remove with a plastic scraper
 - Once all parts are removed from the build plate, wipe it down with a microfiber towel
 - Place the cleared build plate onto the ready-stack
